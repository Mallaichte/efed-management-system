# Read Me
The most important thing to note at the moment is that this is an early stage **work in progress**.

When I started working on this project (and even at the time of writing this), I have had no professional or academic experience in coding/programming/development. I chose an ambitious and challenging project specifically to help me learn to master Python and eventually other languages. Some of my methods may appear unorthodox as a result of my self-taught nature. If you're following changes as we progress, you might even notice significant changes being made to the code and my approach. This has already happened several times before I decided to creat a GitHub Repo to host my work on. One example is when I made the decision to switch from using plain text files (wrestlers/moveslists) to json. Discovering json format has made this project much more efficient and easy. Who knows what similar discoveries I'll make as I learn?

## Why create an efed management system now?
If you're familiar with [efeds](https://ewrestling.fandom.com/wiki/E-federation) then you'll probably think that they're a bit out of style now. You're probably right. I've not been an efedder for nearly 15 years, but it's something I used to enjoy and understand very well. I'm still in touch with lots of friends I've made through efedding who I can call on for advice and opinions. There's still plenty of active efeds around and there's no reason to think that (with the right tools) it could see another surge. More honestly though, I still miss it and would love to work on something related.

One of my first programs was written in Visual Basic while I was still an active efedder. It was for a site called GFed Wrestling (now closed) which used markdown language. The application had a simple GUI to reflect how a roleplayer might interact with the site when posting roleplays. It was designed to help newer roleplayers conform to a customisable format for their roleplays. It also gave them an ability to save and archive their RPs so they would not be lost when a fed closed.

## OK, but why are you sharing this on GitHub?
My primary interest is in information security. I'm about to start a degree course on that, but I'm not ready for sharing any work on that yet (I do have a very simple looping RCE script for CVE-2021-42013 if anyone is interested though).

This is a hobby project and I think GH is perfect for reaching out to eFed communities with an interest in coding for constructive feedback while I work on the project.
